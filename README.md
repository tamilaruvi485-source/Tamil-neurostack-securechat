# 🔐 Secure Chat Application (Python Socket Programming)

## 📌 Project Overview
- This is a Secure Chat Application developed using Python.
- It follows a client–server communication model.
- Messages are encrypted before sending and decrypted at the receiver side.
- This project is created as part of the RISE Internship – Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking.

## ❗ Problem Statement
- Normal chat systems may send messages in plain text.
- Plain text messages can be intercepted by attackers.
- There is a need for secure communication between users.

## 🎯 Objective
- To implement a secure chat system using Python.
- To understand socket programming concepts.
- To demonstrate basic encryption and decryption.
- To ensure confidentiality of transmitted messages.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Networking: Socket Programming
- Encryption: Basic custom encryption logic
- Platform: Windows / Linux

## 🔒 Security Features
- Messages are encrypted before transmission.
- Encrypted data is sent through the network.
- Messages are decrypted only at the receiver side.
- No external libraries or installations are required.

## 🧩 Working Principle
- Server starts and waits for client connection.
- Client connects to the server.
- Sender encrypts the message.
- Encrypted message is transmitted through socket.
- Receiver decrypts and reads the message.
- Two-way communication is supported.

## 📂 Project Structure
- secure_chat_simple.py
- README.md

## ⚙️ How to Run
- Run the Python file using `python secure_chat_simple.py`.
- Select option 1 to start the server.
- Open another terminal and run the same file.
- Select option 2 to start the client.
- Start secure chatting.

## 🧪 Output
- Server shows “Server started… Waiting for client”.
- Client successfully connects to the server.
- Messages are sent and received securely between server and client.

## 📸 Screenshots
- Server running and waiting for client.
- Client connected to server.
- Successful message exchange output.

## ✅ Expected Outcome
- A working secure chat application.
- Demonstrates Python socket programming.
- Demonstrates basic encryption concepts.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Strong encryption algorithms (AES / RSA).
- Graphical User Interface (Tkinter).
- User authentication.
- Group chat support.
